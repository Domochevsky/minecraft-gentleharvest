"Steve, we need to talk."

"Yeah, it's about the way you go about harvesting crops."

"..."

"Right. Could you maybe... iunno, be a little more gentle in how you do it? Like, maybe not rip them out entirely? Or reseed the plants as you go?"

"..."

"Ok, thanks, man. You're the best."

Gentle Harvest is a small mod that automatically replants crops as you harvest them (by punching right-clicking them). In vanilla MC these crops are wheat, potatoes, carrots and cocoa pods. Only fully grown crops are affected.

It should also be compatible with any mod-added crops that extend BlockCrops or BlockCocoa.

Right now the mod is required to exist on both server and client, because Forge says so.
